1.  Product Overview

1.1 What We Are Building
The PIDEC 1.0 platform is a purpose-built web application serving four surfaces: a public landing page, a student competition dashboard, an admin console, and a judge portal. It replaces all manual submission workflows with a controlled, digital-first experience that is verifiable, auditable, and fully managed by the Competitions & Technical Team.
1.2 Platform Goals
•Professional public face for PIDEC 1.0.
•Secure, verified registration for engineering students only (matric validation + AI document verification).
•Structured team formation with role clarity, 48-hour invite system, and pre-Stage-1 lock.
•Full submission lifecycle: Stage 1 proposals, Stage 2 video links + documentation, Stage 3 pre-Finale docs.
•Dedicated Judge Portal: one judge per department, independent scoring, Stage 1 rep selection.
•Feedback delivery from judges directly to teams on the platform.
•Complete admin control over every stage gate, verification, team movement, and content.
•Scalable and reusable for future PIDEC editions (2.0, 3.0, etc.).
1.3 User Types

User Type Who They Are Primary Purpose
Public Visitor Anyone browsing the site Learn about PIDEC, view info, sign up
Student (Unverified) Engineering student, signed up Upload verification doc, await AI approval
Student (Verified) Confirmed engineering student Create/join team, submit, receive feedback
Team Leader Student who created the team Manage team, invites, submissions
Team Member Verified student who accepted invite View team, submissions, feedback
Judge Assigned evaluator (Stage 1 or Stage 2) Score submissions, select rep teams (S1)
Admin Competitions & Technical Team operator Control all platform settings and data
1.4 Platform Versioning
The platform supports multiple PIDEC editions (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) without a rebuild. Each edition has its own isolated theme, stages, teams, tokens, and submissions. A single admin account manages the active edition.

2.  Public Landing Page

Accessible without an account. Admin toggles drive visibility of CTAs and content sections.
2.1 Sections
•Hero: PIDEC logo, edition name, theme, Register and Learn More CTAs (signup CTA conditionally shown based on admin toggle).
•About: mission, ULES context, what PIDEC is.
•Competition Stages: visual timeline of all three stages with dates. Active stage highlighted.
•Participating Departments: all 10 departments. Shows confirmed Stage 2 rep team names once announced.
•Theme: official PIDEC 1.0 theme displayed prominently with contextual description.
•Sponsors & Partners: logos and names managed via admin console. Hidden if empty.
•FAQ: accordion-style. Content managed by admin.
•Footer: ULES branding, PIDEC edition, contact email, competition rules link.

3.  Authentication & Registration

3.1 Sign Up Flow
Step 1 — Basic Account Creation
•Full legal name.
•Email address (login credential).
•Password — minimum 8 characters, at least one letter and one number. bcrypt cost factor 10+. Strength indicator shown.
•Matric number — exactly 9 digits, YYFFDDXXX format. YY: 19–25, FF must be 04 (Engineering). Validated and normalised on input.
•Department — dropdown of all 10 engineering departments.
•Level — dropdown: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500.

Step 2 — Document Upload
•Upload Exam Docket or Course Registration Form. Accepted: PDF, JPG, PNG. Max 5MB.
•File validated client-side (type + size) before any upload attempt.
•Upload is mandatory to proceed.

Step 3 — Automated AI Verification (Async Queue)
•File buffer stored in Redis with 60s TTL — never written to disk or object storage.
•On upload, the job is enqueued in BullMQ. Signup endpoint returns 202 instantly.
•Background worker processes max 10 concurrent jobs (free-tier rate limit protection).
•Groq vision API (primary, free tier): vision prompt extracts name and matric number from document.
•Gemini API (fallback): triggers if Gemini fails, times out, or returns low confidence.
•Matric number normalised before comparison (slashes, spaces, hyphens stripped).
•Department extracted as secondary signal — mismatch flags for review, does not auto-reject.
•File buffer discarded immediately after AI call, regardless of outcome.
•Only verification_status, verification_method, and verification_timestamp written to DB.

Verification Outcomes

Outcome Condition What Happens
Auto-Verified Name + matric match with high confidence. Account verified instantly. Student gets dashboard access.
Auto-Rejected Name or matric clearly do not match, or document unreadable. Student sees specific reason + attempt count (1 of 3). 10-min cooldown between re-uploads. 3-attempt max.
Flagged for Review Both Gemini and Groq return low confidence or both fail. Admin notified. 24hr SLA. Admin sees AI-extracted vs submitted values.

3.2 Account States

State What It Means
Pending Queue processing. Student sees processing screen. Resolves within seconds typically.
Verified AI confirmed name + matric match. Full dashboard access.
Rejected Mismatch detected. Re-upload shown with attempt count + 10-min cooldown. Max 3 attempts.
Flagged Escalated to admin. 24hr SLA. Student sees amber notice.
Suspended Admin manually suspended. No platform access.

3.3 Rate Limiting
•Registration: 5 attempts per IP per 10-minute window.
•Unique constraints: one account per email and per matric number at DB level.
•Re-upload: 3 attempts max, 10-minute cooldown between attempts.
•Login: 10 attempts per IP per 15 minutes. HTTP 429 with retry-after shown.

5.  Team Management

5.1 Team Creation
•Any verified, teamless student may create a team. Name must be unique within the edition.
•Department auto-populated from creator’s profile. Creator becomes Team Leader automatically.
•Team creation permitted only while team management is unlocked (before Stage 1 opens).
5.2 Invite System (48-Hour)
1.Team Leader searches by full name. Results: verified, teamless, same-department students only.
2.Leader sends invite. Invitee notified on dashboard + by email.
3.Invite active for 48 hours. Frontend polls every 60s. Expired invites auto-disable Accept/Decline.
4.Invitee accepts or declines from their own dashboard. No auto-accept.
5.Acceptance adds student as Team Member.

Invite Expiry
Expired invites do not count against limits. Leader can re-invite after expiry. When team lock triggers, existing pending invites remain active — they can still be accepted post-lock. No new invites can be sent after lock. Invitees notified at lock time that this is their last chance to accept.

5.3 Team Leader Rules
•Team Leader cannot leave directly. Must delete the team.
•Deleting a team notifies all members and returns them to teamless state. Permitted only before Stage 1 lock.
•If leader’s account is suspended post-lock: earliest-joining member is auto-promoted to leader. All members notified.
•Leadership cannot be manually transferred in v1.0.
5.4 Composition Rules
•Minimum 3 members (including leader). Maximum 6 members.
•All members must be from the same department — enforced at the platform level.
•A student can only belong to one team at a time.
5.5 Member Suspended Post-Lock
•If a member is suspended after the lock: removed from team. Leader notified.
•If removal drops team below 3 members: team flagged “Under Review.” Admin decides case-by-case. Submission blocked until resolved.
5.6 Team Management Lock
•Locks automatically when admin opens Stage 1 submission window.
•After lock: no new invites, no member removal, no team deletion. Existing pending invites can still be accepted.
•Team Leader and all pending invitees notified when lock activates.
5.7 Submission Token (Stage 1)
•12-character cryptographically random alphanumeric token generated per department.
•Department-scoped: token validates against both token string and submitting team’s department.
•Valid from issuance until Stage 1 deadline. Regeneratable by admin.
•Token use_count and last_used_at tracked on Token entity.

6.  Submission System

All submissions made via the PIDEC platform by the Team Leader only. One submission per stage per team. Enforced at DB level via unique constraint on (team_id, edition_id, stage). Idempotent endpoint returns existing submission on duplicate request within 5 seconds.
6.1 General Submission Flow
6.Admin opens submission window for current stage.
7.Team Leader’s dashboard shows active form.
8.Leader completes form. Live word count shown per field (Stage 1).
9.Read-only review screen shown. Confirmation dialog before final submit.
10.Submission locked on confirm. Timestamp and submitting user ID logged.
11.Team notified via platform + email.

6.3 Stage 2 Submission
Video Submission (All Teams)
Every team — regardless of prototype type (software, hardware, simulation, hybrid) — records a video presenting and demonstrating their solution. The video submission process:
12.Record a video of your solution demonstration.
13.Upload to YouTube (set to Unlisted) or Google Drive (share with view access).
14.Submit the video link on the PIDEC platform as part of the Stage 2 form.
There is no physical submission or in-person inspection at Stage 2.

Video Requirement

•Login via standard login page — routed to Judge Portal by account type.
•Cannot see submissions outside their department assignment.
•Deactivated by admin after judging window closes.
7b.2 Stage 1 Judge Portal
•Unlimited teams from all 10 departments submit Stage 1 proposals.
•Each judge sees all submissions from their assigned department only.
•Judge reads all proposals independently at their own discretion.
•The Stage 1 Scoring Rubric is provided as a reference framework — not a mandatory scoring sheet.
•Judge selects one Representative Team per department — the team they judge strongest.
•All 10 representative teams advance to Stage 2. Stage 1 does not eliminate any department.
•Selections submitted to admin for confirmation before announcement.
7b.3 Stage 2 Judge Portal
•Judge sees all 10 Stage 2 submissions (one per department) from assigned departments.
•All teams submit a video link. Judge views video via platform.
•Judge scores using Stage 2 Scoring Rubric with written comments per criterion.
•Top 5 teams by Stage 2 score advance to Grand Finale.
•Judge submits scores. Admin reviews before publishing to teams.
7b.4 What Teams See
•No judge scores visible until admin publishes.
•Published: scores + criterion-by-criterion feedback on dashboard under stage submission.
•Teams cannot see other teams’ scores.

# Question Context Owner

1 Who develops the platform — Teslim alone or with Ebube? Affects sprint planning and timeline. Chairman
2 Exact website launch date? Targeting April end 2026. TBA by Chairman. Must go live before Stage 1. Chairman
3 Should matric numbers be restricted to unilag.edu.ng email domain? Matric validation (FF=04) already limits to engineering. Email restriction adds a second layer but may exclude students who don’t use institutional email. C&T Team
4 Should eliminated teams receive a disqualification email with a reason? Assumed yes — confirm. C&T Team
